Code for doublePeak 
It needs a list of files for histone marks (tab separated - peak filename in bed format and sig filename in bedgraph format - ENCODE files basically). Different replicates should be on different lines of the file

> ./doublePeaksPositive.py <inpFile> <output.bed>
where:
    inpFile is a file with separate lines for each replicate of H3K27ac experiments. Example is:
encodePeaksRep1.bed	encodeSigRep1.bedgraph
encodePeaksRep2.bed	encodeSigRep2.bedgraph
    output.bed is name of ouput file - bed file with regions of double peaks.

output.bed is then intersected with the narrow peak file from ENCODE for DNase to find the final positive list for training. Code tested on GM12878 files.

TO DO: Add code to do intersectBed within this python script
